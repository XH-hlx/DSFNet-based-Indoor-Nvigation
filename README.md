# DSFNet-based-SEGO
DSFNet is a 3D SSC framework for indoor RGB-D. DAM uses depth completion to repair noisy/incomplete depths. SSFM fuses 2D semantic priors with geometric features for accurate voxel occupancy and labels. The resulting maps drive SEGO, a risk-aware planner producing smoother, safer paths. Validated on NYU/NYUCAD and Gazebo.
